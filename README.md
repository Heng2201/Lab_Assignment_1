# HW1
## Requirement 
This assignment requires one to build a **feedforward neural network (FNN)** to classify the MNIST dataset. The network must have **two hidden layers with 100 and 150 neurons**, and deep-learning libraries such as Pytorch and Tensorflow are not allowed to use.

## Conclusion 
In this homework, I build the FNN using **Numpy** libraries, and can be view [here](obj.py)
